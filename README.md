<br/> Jose set up a circular poker table for his friends so that each of the seats at the table has the same number of poker chips.
<br/> But when Jose wasn’t looking, someone rearranged all of the chips so that they are no longer evenly distributed!
<br/> Now Jose needs to redistribute the chips so that every seat has the same number before his friends arrive.
<br/> But Jose is very meticulous: to ensure that he doesn’t lose any chips in the process, he only moves chips between adjacent seats.
<br/> Moreover, he only moves chips one at a time. What is the minimum number of chip moves
<br/> Jose will need to make to bring the chips back to equilibrium?
